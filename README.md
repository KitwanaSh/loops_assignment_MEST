## While Loops:
A "while" loop is a control structure in JavaScript that allows you to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a specified condition remains true. The basic syntax of a while loop is as follows:

```
while (condition) {
    // Code to be executed while the condition is true
}
```
- The condition is an expression that is evaluated before each iteration. If the condition is true, the code block inside the loop will be executed. If the condition is false from the beginning, the code block is skipped, and the loop terminates without executing any code.

- It is essential to ensure that the condition inside the while loop will eventually become false to prevent an infinite loop. Otherwise, your program will run indefinitely.

- While loops are often used when the number of iterations is unknown and depends on a dynamic condition. For example, you can use a while loop to iterate through an array until a specific element is found or to repeatedly prompt a user for input until they provide valid data.

## Do-While Loops:
- A "do-while" loop is similar to a while loop, but it guarantees that the code block will be executed at least once, even if the condition is initially false. The basic syntax of a do-while loop is as follows:

```
do {
    // Code to be executed at least once
} while (condition);
```

- In a do-while loop, the code block is executed before checking the condition. This means that the code inside the loop will run at least once, regardless of whether the condition is true or false.

- After the initial execution, the condition is checked. If the condition is true, the loop will continue to execute, and if the condition is false, the loop terminates.

- Do-while loops are commonly used when you need to ensure that a block of code runs at least once, such as displaying a menu and allowing the user to make a choice. Afterward, the loop can continue based on the user's input.

- Both while and do-while loops are powerful tools for controlling the flow of your JavaScript programs, and choosing between them depends on your specific requirements and the logic of your program.
